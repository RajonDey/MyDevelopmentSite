      <p>Next.js is a game-changer for e-commerce development due to its server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities. In this post, I’ll walk you through building a performant online store.</p>
      <h2>Setting Up the Project</h2>
      <p>Start by initializing a Next.js app:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">npx create-next-app@latest ecommerce-store --ts</code></pre>
      <p>Next, install Tailwind CSS for styling:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer\nnpx tailwindcss init -p</code></pre>
      <h2>Optimizing Performance</h2>
      <p>Use Next.js Image component for optimized images:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-jsx">import Image from "next/image";\n\nfunction ProductCard({ product }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Image src={product.image} alt={product.name} width={300} height={200} />\n      <h3>{product.name}</h3>\n    </div>\n  );\n}</code></pre>
      <p>This approach ensures fast load times and a great user experience.</p>

    image: "/placeholder.svg?height=200&width=300",
    content: `
      <p>React Hooks revolutionized how we handle state and side effects. Let’s explore two key hooks: <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>.</p>
      <h2>Using useState</h2>
      <p>Here’s a simple counter example:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-jsx">import { useState } from "react";\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}</code></pre>
      <h2>Fetching Data with useEffect</h2>
      <p>Fetch API data on mount:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-jsx">import { useState, useEffect } from "react";\n\nfunction UserList() {\n  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch("https://api.example.com/users")\n      .then(res => res.json())\n      .then(data => setUsers(data));\n  }, []);\n  return <ul>{users.map(user => <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>)}</ul>;\n}</code></pre>

      <p>A headless CMS like Strapi paired with Next.js is perfect for dynamic blogs. Here’s how to set it up.</p>
      <h2>Install Strapi</h2>
      <p>Create a new Strapi project:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-bash">npx create-strapi-app my-blog --quickstart</code></pre>
      <h2>Fetch Posts in Next.js</h2>
      <p>Use getStaticProps to fetch blog posts:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-jsx">export async function getStaticProps() {\n  const res = await fetch("http://localhost:1337/api/posts");\n  const posts = await res.json();\n  return { props: { posts } };\n}\n\nfunction Blog({ posts }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {posts.map(post => (\n        <article key={post.id}>\n          <h2>{post.title}</h2>\n          <p>{post.content}</p>\n        </article>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}</code></pre>
